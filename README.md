# Math131FinalProject
This is a repository for MATH 131, Numerical Analysis Final Porject

Introduction
This would be a project that goes over multiple integrals, specifically double integrals. This is the kind of project that would allow us to determine integrals in multiple dimensions, or in different coordinate systems, and as a whole is something that is important due to their flexibility and ability to not need to be in cartesian coordinates. However, what we will be doing is not as complex and instead will focus primarily on the cartesian coordinate system, and will go over double integration.

Code Proposal
The code provided for this project would start with the base of the composite midpoint and composite trapezoidal rule. These provide estimates for integrals for a single integral. This code would be extracted and enhanced to be more suitable for double integrals. We will be submitting 3 files to accompany the written proposal: main2.m, compMid2.m, and compTrap2.m. main2.m file is a file that will be run, and composes for a for loop that goes from over all of the examples that we will demonstrate against. The goal is to use main2.m as a file to run and test the other files. compMid2.m and compTrap2.m are files that are specifically where we will input composite midpoint or composite trapezoidal rule. These files are just the method, and will consist only of that. They will be called by main2.m to test.

Use
Feel free to use code from this repository as you see fit. Please do remember to give credit to the authors.

UPDATE (December 9, 2020):
As of recently (November 30, 2020), we will only be going over main2.m, compMid2.m, and compTrap2.m, the X3.m files are no longer relevant to our project. Additionally, main2.m and compMid2.m are completed.

Update (December 10, 2020):
Removed main3.m, compMid3.m, and compTrap3.m files from repository. Additionally removed reference to them from README.txt, as well as the written proposal as both are outside the scope of this repository.
